# Protecting Confidential Information in Voyant

There are two ways to protect confidential information when using Voyant. You can set an Access Code when uploading the text or, 
for complete confidentiality, you can run the Voyant Server on your own machine.

## Setting an Access Code

If you want to restrict access to a Voyant corpus you need to set an option right in the Entry screen before you upload the texts for the corpus. 
You can do this by:

1. Go to the Entry screen for [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org)
2. Click the Options button above the Add Texts field. (The button next to the "?" Help.)
3. Scroll down to Access Management section of the Options dialogue box.
4. Enter a code for both the Admin Code and for the Access Code. You can actually list more than one Access Code separated by commas. 
5. Now click OK on the dialogue box and then upload your text as you would normally. If you try to access it, you will need to enter one of the Access Codes.

For more information about the Admin Code and Access Code options see the [Help documentation for Access Management](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/corpuscreator-section-access-management). 

## Running the Voyant Server Locally

The second way to restrict access is to run the Voyant Server on your local machine. That way the indexes are on your machine and can't be access by anyone else. You will then be running the server and accessing it from the same machine so that no one else can get at the corpora.
